        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>One of three cornerstone languages used in web development. Made up of elements that together provide content on the basic framework of all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>Elements: can be seen on a page and divide/describe content to browsers and developers.</li>
          <li>Elements inside of other element are considered child elements (i.e.h1, p, ul, etc.), with the element that holds them being the parent element.</li>
          <li>Opening tag: used at the beginning of content</li>
          <li>Closing tag: used at the end of content</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS: defines how webpages are presented</li>
          <li>There are three ways to stye CSS; inline, internal, and external CSS.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: style an element directly in the HTML file. </li>
          <li>Internal CSS: style an entire section.</li>
          <li>External CSS: Most common and preferred because it allows the dev to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file.</li>
          <li>Class attribute: a CSS rule that adds styles to certain attributes (designated by .card)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git Status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>

        <h2>Jave Script</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A high level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. Takes a static HTML/CSS and makes it interactive.</li>
          <li>Variable: a named container that can store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Conditional Statements and Loops: control how code order is executed.</li>
          <li>Arrays: a single variable used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>"for" Loop: uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>"let" Variable: allows us to reassign the value of the variable over time. Unlike the "const" variable, "let" isn't static.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
