Information gathered to prepare for bootcamp.
# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- What was your motivation? To create a living webpage that can be further added upon. 
- Why did you build this project? So that I can create a webpage to allow myself or others to look back on if we ever run into issues throughout the bootcamp.
- What problem does it solve? The webpage development helps solves the problem of inexperience. Prior to this I had no experience in coding. Now I can say that I know some basic skills.  
- What did you learn? I learned some of the foundations of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with some introductory knowledge of the Git system.

## Usage

The study guide can be used to provide very basic information regardign HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. The idea of the study guide, from my perspective, is to add on as I go. Continuously adding infromation or features will allow for a more well rounded and useful tool that I can always refer back to in a pinch. This also presents an opportunity to get more practice and experience throughout the course.
